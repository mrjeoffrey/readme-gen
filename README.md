<br>

Use this README.md Generator when creating an open source project on GitHub. The output will be a high-quality README which includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions (so you have a higher likelihood of other developers will contributing to the success of the project). You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one and in turn this allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
